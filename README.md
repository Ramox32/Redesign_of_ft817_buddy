A companion display &amp; controls for the FT-817.

This is a work in progess, [more information at my page](http://alloutput.com/amateur-radio/ft-817-companion-display-controls/).

A little story about the build is over at [SWLing Post](https://swling.com/blog/2020/08/andy-builds-a-genius-companion-control-display-for-the-yaesu-ft-817-transceiver/).

Enjoy!
